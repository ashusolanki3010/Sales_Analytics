## Project Overview
The Snowflake Data Pipeline Project is designed to demonstrate the process of building a robust data pipeline using Snowflake as the data warehousing solution and Azure Data Factory (ADF) for data ingestion and orchestration. The pipeline loads raw data into Snowflake, transforms it, and automates the process using Snowflake tasks. This project is ideal for data engineers looking to understand the integration of Snowflake with Azure services.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Load raw sales data from a CSV file into Snowflake.
- **Data Transformation**: Transform raw data to calculate key metrics (e.g., total sales, sales year).
- **Automation**: Automate the data transformation process using Snowflake tasks.
- **Integration with Azure Data Factory**: Utilize Azure Data Factory for seamless data ingestion and processing.
- **Monitoring and Error Handling**: Monitor the task execution and handle any errors that arise.

## Technologies Used
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehousing platform.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Data integration and orchestration service.
- **SQL**: For data manipulation and transformation within Snowflake.
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting platform.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account ([Sign up for free](https://signup.snowflake.com/)).
- An Azure account ([Sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)).
- Intermediate knowledge of SQL and data warehousing concepts.
